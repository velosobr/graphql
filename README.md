# GraphQL
## A repo to mantain graphql studies.
I Used the howtographql website to learn this material.

### Introduction
- GraphQL is <i><b>not</b></i> only for React developers, it cam be used with any programming language.

- It has a rapidly growing community.

### GraphQL is the better REST
 - Stateless servers & structured access to resources.
 - Rest is a strict specification.
 - Rapidly changing requierements on client-side don't go well with the static nature of REST.

1) Fetch everthing with a single request
2) No more Over- and Underfetching
3) Rapid Product Iterations
4) Insightful Analytics
5) Benefits of Schema & Types
